<h1>Unit Testing</h1>
- Involves editing the code to ensure that the functions work as it should. Unit-testing also involves the testing of specific modules or pieces of code within your app.

**Three A's of Unit Testing**

The AAA stands for Arrange, Act, and Assert. This is a great way to make sure we’re covering all aspects of testing a module of code.
- Arrange the state of the data to set it up for testing.
- Act on the data through some method that performs an action.
- Assert that the result from acting on that data is what we expect it to be.

<h1>User Acceptance Testing</h1>

User acceptance testing (UAT) is the final stage of testing. UAT is performed by the end user or the client with the purpose to make sure that the product work as intended and meets the requirements.

During this phase, the testing should not focus on small cosmetic errors nor showstoppers since these should have been detected during the earlier stages: Unit testing, Integration testing, and System testing. Instead, the product should be tested against test scenarios to confirm that the product works in a “real world environment”.
